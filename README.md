# ZestyChat (Phase 1)

Simple anonymous chat using Next.js + Supabase.

## Quick setup

1. Create Supabase project and run SQL setup (you ran earlier).
2. Add environment variables in Vercel (or locally):
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

3. Upload these files to your GitHub repo, connect to Vercel and deploy.

Notes:
- No login: users choose nickname to join.
- Verified features, private messages, storage, and admin dashboard will be added in Phase 2.
